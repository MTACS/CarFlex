# CarFlex

Show FLEX Explorer in CarPlay on iOS 16. To activate, long press on any app icon. Just showing the explorer worked on iOS 14, this has been updated for iOS 16 thanks to [Duy Tran Khanh](https://github.com/khanhduytran0) & [this line](https://github.com/khanhduytran0/MySystemShell/blob/ca9c06537b0394d81332c1cadbc1336aec9ba7a0/ViewController.m#L43)
